Version 1.0: http://min.us/lbuOtsPdEMibD2
Original release, with most of the stuff from my Lua Mod

Version 2.0: http://min.us/lzFWVBYhl5Xfi
Now with MOVING SOLIDS!

Version 2.1: http://min.us/lbvyL8rkNJlcni
Latest source + source now on github

Version 3.0: http://min.us/lbjHzEoxmXAFzP
Added Animated LCRY. Moving solids and ANIM save when you make a stamp or 
save.

Version 4.0: http://min.us/l2FzyIz4AYBS9
Moving solids can rotate now, disabled by default, 
go into the Fav2 menu and click SPIN to allow them to rotate. 
Also added Indestructible insulator and One time wire, 
and did some fixes to FIND and BALL.

Version 5.0: http://min.us/lbh6DDTJzdNFU3
Added automatic and manual heat displays. In automatic heat display, 
the highest temp is pink and the lowest is dark blue. In Manual, 
you can decide which temp is displayed as the hottest color and which is 
the lowest, and everything in between will be based off that. 
I also added powdered portals and virus/cure, and updated to the latest 
source to get rid of the update box.

Version 5.1: http://min.us/lDCKmb9BdFazn
Updated to latest version, added activator, which can be used in creations 
to prevent people from sparking buttons until specific times. Also, re-added 
in buttons to switch to the different modes, except blob and heat gradient.

Version 6.0: http://min.us/lUgHNsGndzdbh
Added powered invisible, blob and heat gradient display, portal effects, and 
wifi/portal lines. Also added the old lua console commands: sound(must be 
enable with a shortcut), load, bubble, reset_temp, and reset_pressure(works 
with the same parameters reset_velocity does). There are three new lua 
commands: get_pressure, get_gravity, and maxframes(sets the number of frames 
ANIM can have when created, 1-256). Also, render_ui uses the old cmode 
pictures in color.Note: the button keys to change display modes, blob & heat 
gradient display, portal effects (Simon forgot the wifi/portal lines), and 
new icons all got into the official version. Not much of this code was 
actually written by me, a lot of it was taken from github after Simon deleted 
it. He said he might add in more stuff that I wrote later.

Version 7.0: http://min.us/lK604TH6bFNV4
Added readme. Faster drawing and deleting of elements. Added RAZR, an element
heavier than all other elements. Added new button in FAV2 menu that can make
saves compatible with the latest beta or release version and able to be
published. It makes sure that you don't add in any new elements not in those
versions. PINV+PHOT = ELEC. SPNG drags along other particles with it, even 
solids that normally can't move.

Version 8.0: http://min.us/muN92vQxC
Wall names display in the hud. New lua functions: get_wall and create_wall. A 
New Wall: ERASEALL. It can erase walls, signs, and particles all at once. 
Most powered elements drawn in this version are now activated instantly. Set 
the tmp to zero to keep the old way of activating. New properties that can be 
set using the lua console: CLONE (0x40000), BREAKABLECLONE (0x80000), 
POWERED (0x100000), and INDESTRUCTIBLE (0x20000). Use the first 3 together to 
make different kinds of clone using elements. The last one makes things 
invincible to every element, and even prevents it from being destroyed in 
reactions. You can make things like indestructible WATR or METL. Lua code can 
now be saved. Put it in luacode.txt, and it will be saved and run in 
stamps/saves. Press up in the console and then enter to load an example.

Version 9: http://min.us/muN92vQxC
Fix loading some saves and fixed crash with HUD. Removed update button 
permanently and updated to newer source. Also, decoration color is now drawn 
on stamps in the stamp browser. 2 new quickoptions: Newtonian gravity and 
ambient heat. Custom HUDs. To change one, click the HUD2 button in the second 
favorites menu and different options will come up. You can change all 4 of 
the original HUD's and it will save and be loaded the next time you start. 
Also added a few more options not in any normal HUD.

Version 10
Added display mode toggles, press Ctrl+ a number key besides 4 and 8 to 
toggle the main feature of that display temporarily. Added more statistics. 
Fixed some moving solid bugs and made rotation save. Updated to newest 
source, which includes the new save format, but you can choose to save in the 
old format instead. You can delete corrupted stamps now. Fix three powered 
electronic related bugs, all electronics should work like they're supposed 
to now. Added a decoration smudge (blend) tool

Version 11 - 2/21/12
Added PROP2 tool, you can draw properties on with the normal brush now. 
Improved decoration drawing speed and added a hex value display and floodfill 
to it. Changed menus of some elements. Added a new test icon for the favorites 
menu. Added an update check, if there is a new version, you can use the link 
in the message of the day to download a zip file containing the next version 
of this mod. Added COND, only conducts to other COND with same tmp within a 
tmp2 radius. Added PWHT, flood fill heats the element above it to it's temp. 
Use PROP on it to make it create other properties. Added rechargeable battery, 
set the tmp of battery to the maximum charge it can hold, METL to charge, 
PSCN/NSCN to turn on/off. Some other stuff not listed here.

Version 12 - 3/2/12
Added tabs. Hit the tab button in the quickoptions menu or press Ctrl to show 
a menu of all the tabs you have open. You can switch between them, or open a 
new one (what you are doing is copied over). Tabs are saved and not simulated 
when you are not using them. Press shift to save pressure in stamps and saves, 
RCTRL to keep it when transforming stamps. Added fusion. see thread 12901 for 
more info (http://powdertoy.co.uk/Discussions/Thread/View.html?Thread=12901). 
Added realistic mode, not by me and not too noticeable. Autosave button, 
disabled by default. If Powder Toy unexpectedly closes, the next time you 
open it your work will appear. Fix decoration tools.

Version 12.1 - 3/3/12
Make text say version 12, not 10. Remove update check and replace it with 
another link. Fix crash when you click the LUA button and luacode.txt was 
missing

Version 13 - 3/18/12
Fix glitch when VOID-like elements eat particles. Changes and fixes to FIND 
tool, can also now find walls. Ctrl+F to quickly find and Ctrl+S to save the 
current tab/create a backup in case of a crash. Shift+R reloads the current 
tab without saving, Ctrl+Q then clicking yes completely exits from anywhere, 
and Ctrl+O opens the saves catalogue. You can now edit alpha in the deco 
editor. Alpha is displayed in (OPS) stamps, all wall types drawn in all 
stamps. save/load more things in powder.pref. Now uses static Libraries, no 
dll's are needed. Some fusion changes to make it more controllable.

Version 14 - 4/1/12
Lua code in saves run in a limited environment without access to dangerous 
functions that could cause a virus. Prevent infinite loops in Lua, they will 
exit after 3 seconds (you can click cancel to let it continue running though).
Oxygen fusion added. 4 New commands: tpt.clear_sim(), tpt.restore_defaults(),
tpt.reset_elements(). Moving solid ability added to all elements, use 
tpt.enable_moving_solids() to make all solids move like BALL does. That last 
one was an April fools joke, if you couldn't tell already.

Version 14.1 - 4/7/12
Really update to latest source. Fix infinite fusion and burning oxygen. CLNE 
and PCLN are indestructible, BCLN and PBCN break with DEST and SING again. 
BHOL, VENT, and VOID are not destroyed by DEST or SING now. New lua commands: 
tpt.draw(or fill)circle(x,y,rx,ry,r,g,b,a) and tpt.indestructible(string name 
or particle number). An optional argument to that is a 0, which makes it 
destructible again. Added Easter egg hunt, press 'e' to start. Removed in 
version 15.

Version 14.2 - 4/30/12
update to latest source again. reversible pipe - spark with PSCN to reverse, 
NSCN to unreverse. This mod is temporarily discontinued, but will be started 
again in May/June.

Version 15 - 5/22/12
Fix some deco editor bugs. Element descriptions fade in and out nicely.Fixes 
to the old menu, the favorites menu is always drawn on bottom when using that. 
Ability to make custom lua graphics functions. Fix glitch in HUD (life 
wouldn't show up). You can scroll through comments on saves, but only 10 at 
most are able to show up. User ID's are now drawn on comments. You can write 
in color now. Use Ctrl  + one of these letters: w (white), g (grey), o 
(orange), r (red), l (red-orange), b (blue), and t (light blue). Colors can 
go in comments, tags, and save names and be seen by all tpt users. They can't 
go in signs or local saves names (colors are removed). Update to 79.2 source.

Version 16 - 6/14/12
VOID and PVOD can be set to only eat their ctype (or only not eat it if their 
tmp is 1). Local save deletion inside tpt. Fix saving as release/beta version, 
fix many saving problems. Fix SING explosion. lua functions can be auto-
completed when writing commands in the console (ex. type "tpt.s" and press 
tab, it changes to "tpt.set_property("). Works with many common lua console 
commands/things. Lightning can be cloned and it's initial direction is 
affected by Newtonian gravity too. Right HUD always drawn on top. Moving 
solids are solid inside and much less glitchy. Also, use tpt.moving_solid() 
to allow any element to move like moving solid.

Version 16.1 - 6/18/12
Fix saving as release version, fix saves with LIGH in them. Fix PIPE exploding 
when energy particles went in it. Front page labeled as page 1, not page 0. 
Up to 100 comments on saves can be loaded now, they are loaded as you scroll 
down. Moving solids don't collide with particles they can go through. Fix 
moving solids causing stacking and BHOL being created. Update to latest source 
again (still 80.4) which fixes some other bugs.

Version 16.2 - 6/18/12
Fixed saving saves publicly, remove ability to create colored text.

Version 16.3 - 6/25/12
Make Some lua console shortcuts less annoying. Fix compression during fusion 
and with moving sponge. Fix moderator name colors, also, your name is yellow 
and save creators is red. Update to latest source.

Version 17.0 - 7/5/12
Many minor graphical fixes to the HUD. FIND can find 3 things at once. Left 
selected element is red, right selected is blue, and alternate selected is 
green. LCtrl/RCtrl/Shift + F to toggle these. Also, a new FIND2 button which 
toggles an alternate find mode more similar to my lua script, where first 
everything is dimmed, and then a dot is put over what you're finding. Click 
a user ID to switch to showing comment post times and dates instead. Use the 
DATE button to change the format. Date format also applies to the HUD now, if 
you chose to display it. The areas for stamp saving, copying, and cutting can 
be drawn backwards now. Fix first comment on saves not showing. Fix crash bug 
with powered electronics and moving solids, ANIM activated instantly now too. 
New flood-fill brush shape. Many speed improvements by skipping unneeded 
things. WOOD and PLNT look burnt when hot and frozen when cold. VIRS has a 
small chance of destroying CURE. saving stamps looks better & you can delete 
multiple stamps at once with Ctrl+red delete button. Many other minor fixes 
and changes.

Version 18 - 8/2/12
Fix bug where all solids could move like SPNG, fix low pressure transition not 
working. Fix lava's ctype getting changed. You can now highlight text in 
textboxes and copy/delete just that. SING with a tmp2 of 1 emits gravity 
instead of pressure (still creates tons of pressure anyway), and with a tmp2 
of 2 does both. Antimatter's ctype and tmp act tike VOID's (eats it's ctype). 
Right click the reload button to go back to open_ui. Fix moving solids not 
showing in HUD. Add scrollbar to scrolling menus. Fix VACU/VENT. Limit the 
FPS everywhere, so tpt doesn't use 100% CPU when you're not in the main game. 
Tons of new lua commands, you can pass nothing into functions that set a 
variable to return that variable instead. When changing the screen size, you 
can change it even if your screen if too small if you want. Improvements to 
open_ui, you can click a username to search for their saves, and shift click 
to see their profile.

Version 18.1 8/7/12
Fix crash when saving invalid elements (that you shouldn't have anyway). Add 
an icon to the deco menu and element search ui. Disable reversible pipe on non 
mod saves. Improvements to the deco menu to make it feel more like the editor, 
fix middle click to get decocolor inside of it. Fix graphics function crash. 
Fixes to PWHT so that it works and saves better. Fix instantly powered 
electronics not saving. Combine PROP & PROP2. To use old prop, flood fill with 
Ctrl + Shift. Fix TRON. GEL and SPNG can absorb water from elements and leaves 
behind what the element was mixed with. (ex. PSTE + SPNG -> CLST). Ask to run 
lua code in saves, instead of just running automatically.

Version 19 8/22/12
Update to version 82, with all the things I added to that including powered 
pipe. Fix comments with '/n' in them not displaying correctly. Fix BRAY/EMBR 
graphics (PMODE_GLOW), make it easier to find stickmen with FIND tool. Add 
tpt.outside_airtemp, sets the outside ambient heat temperature. More custom 
HUD options, plus fix a few bugs with it. Fix H2 and O2 not burning at high 
temperatures (from Triclops200 in tpt++). Edge loop option.

Version 19.1 9/2/12
Fix some stickmen spawning glitches (still in tpt though). Fast quit option 
(found in the simulation options). Compatibility with saves made in tpt++ 
(fixes walls). Fix deco not showing when drawing on ANIM. The extra 1st 
page saves option stays on like the other search options do. Add things from 
tpt version 83.0 (DTEC, things from my pull request).

Version 19.2 10/5/12
Allow longer comments on saves, and the comment box resizes to fit. Allow 
longer signs to be loaded in saves and make the sign creation ui larger to 
allow you to make signs the size they are in tpt++. Fix clicking usernames on 
the bottom row of saves not working. Add some minor simulation changes made 
in tpt and tpt++.

Version 19.3 10/19/12
Fix minor problem where PBCN and PLCN wouldn't clone until a frame after they 
were activated. Fix really long comments not loading, the comments not being 
drawn to the very bottom, bugs with the resizing comment box, jump when 
scrolling past certain comments, and scrolling when typing certain letters in 
the comment box. Use {t:id|text} to link to forum threads and {s:query|text} 
to start a save search (added by me in tpt++ first). Added tpt++ elements: 
DMG and TSNS. Fix being unable to save PIPE sometimes (error when saving, 
invalid element). Fix some moving solid crashes. Fix HUD showing incorrect 
values with double scale enabled. Don't load selected elements or render mode 
in saves anymore. Fix tpt bug that will cause you to get logged out sometimes 
when you shouldn't. Fix another tpt bug where Newtonian gravity wouldn't get 
reloaded after reloading a save - thanks to jacksonmj for the fix. Make VIRS 
last longer. Enable the # of votes icon on all saves for everyone.

Version 19.4 11/3/12
Remove DISPLAY_EFFE from render options. Fix clicking the copy id button 
exiting the save preview. Fix being able to click usernames and id's from 
under the comment box (again). Shift-clicking a username from the my own 
section to search for their saves will work correctly now. Fix shift/ctrl 
clicking moderators' not searching correctly. Increase number of comments that 
can be loaded to 200. Add in VIBR and BVBR from tpt++ (still not the final 
version, 19.4.1 will be soon). Fix PROP_NEUTPENETRATE. Fix bug causing switch 
to act differently in some rare cases. Fix tools menusection having an extra 
empty space in old menu ('o') mode. Add 'Empty' edge mode option.

Version 19.4.1 11/5/12
Fix save as current name and improve how saving works (will allow public / 
mod saves easily now). Put in the final version of VIBR. Make the thumbnails 
look as good as I can get them, tpt++'s thumbnail renderer isn't as good, so 
new thumbnails won't look as good. Add sensors menu icon.

Version 20.0 12/6/12
Fix DTEC and TSNS not detecting energy particles. Make pressing enter not 
open the save in the save preview, deleting the comment. Make an error while 
sending a comment (like posting too frequently) not delete the comment. Fix not 
being able to remove convo notifications. Fix VIRS+water equalization. Fix any 
differences with SWCH and other electronics from tpt that was breaking saves. 
Some minor simulation updates from tpt++. Add back color presets to deco 
editor, fix some minor bugs with the editor. Add in updater! Thanks to mniip 
for the space on his server. This readme probably won't update with future 
updates, but you can still see it on the mod's thread and on github.

updates from tpt++ (DTEC detecting GOL fix, VOID/BHOL eat LIGH). Paused 
checkbox when saving.

Version 21.0 1/25/13
Change login to tpt++ method, if you login again, this allows comments to be

comments after submitting one. Highlightable comments. Deco menu must be 
clicked to open (like tpt++ will be), or press b. New tpt++ elements before 
they are out (possibly incomplete): CRAY, PSTN, FRME. All the tpt++ lua api's 
except for interface, lua scripts using the elements api will work now this 
means. Fix '[' / ']' keys not scrolling comments when not logged in. An option

the recent description changes and menusection changes. Remove OTWR and COND 
from the menu. Some other things from tpt++ like bluescreens and saving 
window position. Way better console, there is a dragable dividing line 
between them and results will never overlap with the commands. Textboxes can 
also be resizable, and console commands / output is highlightable now. Also 
command history is saved / loaded to powder.pref, and a few other fixes to 
some other interfaces. Increase maximum stamp pages to 25. A lot of fixes 
and changes to textboxes, you can double / triple click them like text in 
other programs.

Version 23.1 6/2/13
Fix almost irreversible infinite crashing loop with the new bluescreens. They 
would try to nicely reload your work after the crash, but when it was the save 
that crashed it, it would constantly restart and keep crashing, and be very 
hard to stop. Fix crash with LIGH :P. Fix a bunch of small bugs with textboxes 
and labels from the last update, including multiple comments being selected at

descriptions. A ton of simulation updates and bugfixes from tpt++. Change 
internal version number to 88.0 (doesn't affect saving). ctrl+z works better 
and goes back to the last time you drew something or opened a save. Overhaul 
of tabs. They now save more info inside them, and they have their own 
thumbnailsand names. Right clicking a tab will delete it, and you can use the 
reloadbutton to reload a tab. Ctrl+s to save it and set a new reload point, 
ctrl+n tostart a new tab, 't' to open / close the tabs menu. If installed,

enough people suggest an element, it must be good, and therefore should be added.
That's why this version adds 15 NEW ELEMENTS! That more then doubles the current
mod elements. I've added long suggested elements such as breakable diamond (DMD2),
broken diamond (BDMD), DIRT, MUD, POOP, and blood (BLOD). I've also added some
gems that never got noticed, such as dinosaur knee liquid (DKLQ, thanks to
therocketeer), coconut (COCO), and disappearing metal (DIMT). Also included: COCJ,
LOLZ2, BATT, CMD, OBMA, and STKW. Special thanks to CatAnimation for suggesting
many of these useful elements. ... Oh, and I fixed the zoom window bugs.

resetting to .type, without indicating it was doing so. Add back PWHT
because some people still use it. The feature where it can set any property
(not just .temp) was adjusted slightly. .tmp2 no longer needs to be set, it can
now set pavg0 and pavg1, and setting .type is now ctype 3 instead of 0.

Version 44.0 2020-01-28

option to use higher scale modes than double scale, if monitor resolution is
high enough. The rest of the changelog is all stuff I copied over from vanilla.

stamps now sorts by time created. Revise ctype drawing code, add Lua event
listeners for this. Add Lua event listeners for create, create_allowed, and
change_type. Ability to set default properties in Lua. Make water equalization
fill in areas slightly more naturally. Add (default) option to make deco tools
use sRGB color space, Gamma 1.8 and Gamma 2.2 were also added. Add option to
use perfect circle brush instead of TPT's nonstandard circle calculations. Fix
STK2 rocket boots not saving in saves. Guess best scale on startup. Add http
