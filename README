Jacob1's Mod, tpt's longest lasting and most popular mod! My overall goal 
isn't to add a bunch of elements you can forget about, it's to create a 
more stable tpt version without many bugs and lots of new features not fit for 
the officiel version; like multiple tabs, an updated save preview and moving 
solids. It it based off the older codebase of tpt version 83, back when things 
were in C and simpler; this allows me to do things how I want without the few 
small but unfixable bugs tpt++ has.

The mod updates whenever I feel like it. Don't ignore the update notifications 
like you do in other mods though, this mod actually has it's own in game 
updater, hosted at https://starcatcher.us/TPT. Typically there is an update,
no matter how small, once every 1-2 months, although that is constantly 
changing as my schedule and interest in working on the mod changes. All the 
changes made to tpt are quickly backported into the mod, making it much more up 
to date and quicker to test new official features.

When you first start up the mod, it might look a lot different (or the same, 
if you remember what TPT used to look like before the rewrite). Everything 
functions exactly the same though. There are a few areas you may want to look 
at to see the new features. The main one is the sub menus in the favorites menu. 
The favorites menu is the first feature added to the mod. Although it is now in 
the official version, the submenus are unique to the mod. You can find many 
options here, all in element button format (i'll make an actual options ui 
someday ....). Elsewhere, if you click the 'T' quickoption in the top right you 
can access the 'tabs' feature. Other changes can be seen in the redone console 
or in the save preview. An in detail explanation of these features and others 
are provided below.

Favorites Menu / Submenus
The favorites menu has been the center of most things in the mod since the 
beginning. To "favorite" an element, ctrl+shift click it from any menu, and 
it will get a yellow heart by it. To unfavorite it, ctrl+shift+right click 
it instead. Any recently used elements also will appear in the menu.
If you click the MORE button, a new menu will appear with more options. 
HUD's are customizable using the HUD2 button. The FIND button colors whatever 
element you have selected red, and dims everything else (now in official TPT, 
with the ctrl+f shortcut). There's also a way to double or triple highlight 
things in green and blue at the same time, if you click the button more times. 
FND2 changes the way find is displayed for layered particles. The INFO button 
displays statistics about how long and how many times you have played powder 
toy, your average FPS, and info about the current save. REAL turns on realistic 
heat mode by savask. DATE changes date and time settings, used in the HUD and on 
save comments. In addition to left clicking, right clicking it will toggle 
displaying time on comments older than a day. The rest (SPIN, HEAT, LUA) are 
explained later in the readme.

Moving Solids
No lag, and it actually works. They are found in the special menu, and you 
can have a maximum of 256 at once. They are drawn the same shape as your 
brush, no matter what shape or size it is. They are very bouncy, and fall 
with gravity. Pressure over 10.0 will destroy them, and if the center 
particle is destroyed, it will fall apart, making really tiny bouncing 
pixels. Go into the FAV2 menu and click SPIN to make them able to rotate, now 
enabled by default. Recent version 29 additions allow them to properly move 
around in loop edge mode and to bounce off walls. Version 30 rewrites them 
internally, while paused any moving solids you draw will all be attached as 
one ball (even if they aren't attached physically). This allows you to create  
unique shapes.

Animated LCRY
Found in the powered elements menu. In the decoration editor, 
press left or right to change frames, and paint each frame normally. Press 
Del to delete a frame or press Ctrl+right when going to a new frame to copy 
the old one over to the new one. PSCN activates it, and the speed that it 
changes depends on its temperature. NSCN deactivates it. METL pauses/unpauses
it. If you set the tmp2 of the PSCN or NSCN that (de)activates it, you can 
set which frame ANIM starts or freezes at. Also, you can use the tmp of the 
PSCN to set the delay for the first frame. You can have a maximum of 25 
frames, unless you use the lua command tpt.maxframes(num), where num is the 
new maximum, between 1 and 256. Using that command will reset all existing 
ANIM. If you delete a lot of it at once, the game will freeze for a while to 
free all the allocated memory, just wait and it will keep working.

New Heat Displays
Found in the FAV2 menu. Click the HEAT button once to go to automatic display 
mode, where the hottest temp is always pink, the lowest is dark blue, and 
everything else in between is based off of that. Click it again to go into 
manual heat display. The min and max temps will stop changing when you go 
into this, so it will help if automatic mode flickers because of something 
like CLNE(FIRE) constantly changing the max temp. If you right click the 
button, it will ask you to enter the new maximum and minimum temp. Enter the 
temperatures in Celsius. It will change the display mode into manual 
automatically after this.

Powered Elements
All powered elements are now activated instantly. When you start the mod or 
clear the sim, a setting is set which causes all powered elements to be 
instantly activated. Saves loaded from official TPT don't have this set, so 
will maintain compatibility. Elements from the mod are always activated 
instantly regardless of this setting. Also, if you want to make a powered 
element in Lua it's as simple as setting PROP_POWERED, it will handle the 
life values for you (you will have to do the graphics though).

Lua Code
Put a Lua script in luacode.txt and click the LUA button in the FAV2 menu. It 
will read the script and then run it once the following frame. If you need 
something to run every frame, use tpt.register_step. Once you do this the 
script becomes "embeded" in every save and stamp you create. When you load the 
save, it will write the code back out to newluacode.txt and ask if you want 
to run it. This is just so that you can see what you are running and look for 
malicious code before it is executed. Clearing the simulation will also make 
it forget about any code, although there may still be side effects from the 
script.

Custom HUDs
Inside the HUD2 menu you can click on HUD2 to make a customized HUD. By 
default the mod has a custom HUD on that fixes many issues of the original 
HUD (but these fixes are in TPT now). You can also customize the original HUD 
too (toggled with HUD button), and both debug mode HUDs. Theoretically, you 
could have 4 HUDs saved at once, and the HUD2 menu will edit whichever is 
enabled at the time. After clicking HUD2, there are more submenus. RSET will 
reset all of the HUDs back to their default values. CORD lets you toggle 
options related to the second row in the debug HUD. INFO lets you change 
options related to the uper right line. UI lets you change the things 
displayed in the upper left. Most buttons in these submenus are toggles, but 
anything ending in # brings up an input box and allows you to set how many 
decimal places things like pressure and temperature are displayed to.

Tabs
Tabs are shown in the 'T' quickoption on the upper right. clicking it toggles 
showing tabs, you can also hold control to view the tab list. Tabs are 
basically alternate simulations, which save everything including pressure and 
current save info. A few really advanced settings may not be saved, as behind 
the scenes it is simply saving a stamp. They aren't simulated when you aren't 
looking at them but still have uses. To save the current tab to disk, press 
ctrl+s. You can then use the reload button from this point, even without an 
account or looking at a save from the save server. You could just stop here 
with the tab feature, and only use a single tab for reloading, but there is a 
lot more. To create a new tab, press ctrl+n or click the '+' icon in the tab 
menu. Your previous tab will be saved. When hovering over tabs it will 
display a thumbnail preview and the name of the save so you can quickly 
identify them. Right clicking on a tab will delete it.
Two obscure features to note: If you are on the main tpt screen and you open a
save from the tpt website, it will open it in a new tab instead of launching 
a new instance of tpt. Also, if your game crashes for any reason, it will 
save your current tab and restart TPT automatically with all of your previous 
tabs intact.

Console
The console has been redone to fix many issues the original one had. Text 
will no longer overlap, it properly wraps text on both the input and output 
sides, allowing you to see overly long commands. You can drag the line in the 
middle of the console to adjust how much room either side gets. The console
also now scrolls, allowing you to see the previous 20 commands and command
output. When typing a command the input will also wrap around, fixing the
arbitrarily short limit of the console in vanilla TPT. In addition, console
output is saved to powder.pref so you can see what previous commands returned.
Syntax highlighting from vanilla TPT has not been added yet.

Save Preview
This may not look a lot different than the default TPT, because tpt++ 
overhauled the save preview itself when it was redone in c++. It used to be 
cutting edge though! My mod doesn't have avatars or a scrollbar yet, but it 
does have other cool features. Comment scrolling works with the scrollwheel on 
your mouse, or the '[' and ']' keys. There are no 'pages' like in tpt++, it's 
just a continuous stream of comments. It will attempt to display the page 
number tpt would have on bottom, but at the moment it can't properly display 
the maximum number of pages due to API limitations. To the right of each name 
is the date and time each comment was posted. You can edit how this is 
displayed with the DATE option in the fav2 menu. If you click it, it will 
toggle showing User ID's instead. Clicking the 'Submit' button without anything 
in the textbox will reload the comments. The comment box turns red when the 
comment is too long to be submitted (the server currently has a 500 character 
limit). Left clicking a username will append their nick to the end of the 
textbox to make it easier to reply to their comment without having to type out 
the username. Shift-clicking their username will open a search for all of their 
public saves. Ctrl-clicking their username will open the profile UI with their 
bio and avatar.

------------------------------------History-----------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The original point of this mod was the favorite elements menu back in version 
1. It was intended to do everything my badly written lua script did, because 
several users such as @MasterMind555 encouraged me to start developing tpt. 
It was very ambitious, I barely knew how to code and claimed version 2 would 
have moving solids, something everyone said was impossible. Version 1.0 
was released on October 18th, 2011, with the Version 2.0 moving solids update 
shortly after. I added many random suggestions and almost all the current 
elements within the few months after the original release. Over time, I have 
fixed a lot of the original things (moving solids back then were hollow and 
had bad collisions) as I figured out what I was doing.

At some point, I decided to add @BoredInSchool's fusion suggestion into my 
mod. Everyone loved it, and I decided to try and get some of my code into the 
official game. After two pull requests filled with fusion, lots of bug fixes, 
and other small features, I was unexpectedly made a moderator. A few months 
later I was given access to the repo to help fix all the bugs in the c++ 
rewrite. Three times before I have stopped work on this for periods of a month 
or more, but I always come back to it and keep it up to date as new tpt 
versions are released. Originally, I had planned to port my mod into the c++ 
rewrite in hopes it would be merged into official. Eventually I realized that 
was never going to happen, and in fact I didn't want this in official. I like 
being able to do whatever I want without having others tell me what needs to 
be done and what can't be put in. I went into full backporting mode, putting 
all the missing features from the c++ rewrite into my mod so that you 
wouldn't miss any features when using this. Even though i'm really busy with 
college, I am still doing this today, and now plan to rewrite a few parts 
into c++ myself so that I can add more features.

Sometime in the middle, I thought the idea of having a special update server 
would be cool. @mniip offered to host it for me, with his new server. I 
quickly put something together that even had in game changelogs, and he did 
the server side script. It worked great, this helped keep people interested 
in the mod, because they didn't need to redownload every new version, and 
eventually get tired of it. Now, a lot of people actually use this as an 
entire tpt replacement (including me).
